# Binary Tree

A `tree` is a frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.

Each node of the tree will have a root value and list of references to  tohter nodes which are called child nodes. From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph which has `N nodes` and `N-1 edges`.

A `Binary Tree` is one of the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has `at most two children`, which are referrred to as the left child and the right child.


## Traverse a Tree

Pre-order: root, left, right
In-order: left, root, right
Post-order: left, right, root
